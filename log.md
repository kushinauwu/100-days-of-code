<!--##### (delete me or comment me out)-->

**Today's Progress**: Figuring out how to fork repositories. STarted freecodecamp's front end dev course.

**Thoughts:** Fook I'm sleepy. Not a lot was done today.


### Day 2: Juy 17th 2017


**Today's Progress**: Finished html stuff. Started working on CSS functionalities. Learning how to overwrite styles.

**Thoughts**: This is fun. Also, BTS and programming is a good combination. For some reason it was easier to concentrate with Fire in the background ahhhhaha. I'll update again when i get back to programming.

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.
