### Day 2: Juy 17th 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished html stuff. Started working on CSS functionalities. Learning how to overwrite styles.
*Edit:* Finishd the CSS course on freecodecamp.

**Thoughts**: This is fun. Also, BTS and programming is a good combination. For some reason it was easier to concentrate with Fire in the background ahhhhaha. I'll update again when i get back to programming.
*Edit:* I feel like I can do a lot of cool shit with this. I'll start with Bootstrap tommorrow. Productive affff
